# 🛫 Flight Delay Prediction & Operations Optimization

A predictive analytics and intelligent visualization project that transforms aviation operations by preventing delays, optimizing resources, and improving passenger experience.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This project addresses the **$26B+ annual global cost of flight delays** by moving from reactive reporting to **proactive prediction and optimization**. It leverages machine learning, real-time data, and interactive dashboards to identify high-risk flights, optimize crew and gate assignments, and reduce cascading operational disruptions.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Machine Learning** – Gradient Boosting & Random Forest ensemble for delay prediction.
* **Data Sources** – Flight schedules, weather forecasts (NOAA), FAA/BTS delay records, airport operations, crew/maintenance schedules.
* **Visualization** – Interactive Executive Operations Dashboard with heatmaps, alerts, and what-if simulations.
* **File Format** – PDF/PPTX for presentation and documentation.

---

## 📂 Data Sources

* **Flight Operations** – Real-time schedules, rotations, turnaround requirements.
* **Weather Intelligence** – Forecasts, micro-weather conditions, historical weather patterns.
* **Airport Operations** – Runway congestion, gate availability, security checkpoint flow.
* **Historical Performance** – FAA/BTS delay records, seasonal delay trends, airline-specific patterns.

## 🔍 Features & Highlights

### Business Problem

* Flight delays cause **$26B+ annual global losses**, with an average cost of **$74 per minute**.
* Reactive reporting leaves airlines struggling to manage congestion, weather, and resource constraints.

### Dashboard Goals

* Predict delays before they occur.
* Optimize resource allocation (gates, crew, turnaround times).
* Enable data-driven decision-making with what-if analysis.

### Walkthrough of Key Insights

* **Risk Heatmap**: Visualizes flights by delay probability (Low, Medium, High).
* **Real-Time Alerts**: Notifies operations teams about high-risk flights.
* **What-If Simulations**: Models gate reassignments, crew swaps, and turnaround buffers.
* **Performance Metrics**: Tracks cost savings, delay reductions, and operational efficiency.

---

## ✅ Proposed Solutions

* **Predictive Modeling** – Delay probability scores with confidence intervals.
* **Scenario Planning** – Test operational strategies before execution.
* **Decision Support** – AI-powered recommendations for resource optimization.
* **Integration Roadmap** – Phased adoption (Historical → Real-time → Prescriptive AI).

---

## 📈 Business Impact & Expected Outcomes

* **25% Reduction** in flight delays.
* **18% Cost Savings** from reduced fuel burn, crew overtime, and compensation.
* **35% Resource Efficiency** via optimized gate and crew scheduling.
* Enhanced **passenger experience**, loyalty, and revenue protection.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

* Deploy predictive dashboard into airline operations.
* Integrate additional real-time data feeds (IoT, live weather APIs).
* Iterate models with continuous training on new performance data.
* Expand to multi-airline, multi-airport operational environments.
